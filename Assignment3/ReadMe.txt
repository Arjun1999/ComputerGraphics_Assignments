To run the Illuminator :

1) Switch to the 'CodeBase' subfolder within the 'Code' folder and run 'python3 -m http.server'

Please Note:

1. The demo has been broken into two videos. Despite numerous attempts, I just couldn't get them in a single video without my laptop giving out. I hope you could bear with me on this.

2. One can lookup the contraint logic in light.js and mesh.js  

3. After the constraint has been violated in scale down, there are times when the model does not scale up. On printing the scale factors, I see that the decimal places don't go to zero and maybe these cause the irregular behaviour. I am not sure on this but the code logic does seem pretty straightforward.
